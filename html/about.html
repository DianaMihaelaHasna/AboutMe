    <h1>Team Work</h1>
    <p>Even though most of the time I am a single player,
	I like to work on my own and get everything done by myself, I am also a team player. 
	<p>
I believe that, being part of a team, you learn to better understand the wishes and
 needs of others as well as your own.
 <p>Also it is a good opportunity to learn new ways to address a problem.
 <p> You know how they say, two heads are better than one.

    <h1>Loving and protecting animals</h1>
    <p>One of the most beautiful and relaxing moments are those I spend with my pets.
	<p>I have always fought and will continue to fight for the protection of animals.
	<p>My bachelor's thesis consisted of a web application intended for the adoption of animals but also to protect them
	through different ways,by reporting an abuse or abandonment. I think there are various ways, 
	many undiscovered or not yet implemented,through which technology can help to protect them.
