      <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
      <br><p>Even though I am not a huge fan of programming languages, I do know a thing or two about the 
	  following ones : 
	  <dt >
	  <dl>Python</dl>
	  <dl>C</dl>
	  <dl>C++</dl>
	  <dl>Html</dl>
	  <dl>Css</dl>
	  <dl>Php</dl>
	  <dl>SQL</dl>
	  <dl>JavaScript</dl>	  
<p>My preferences ​​are
 the languages ​​specific to the front end.</p>
	  
	  
	  </dt>
	  </p>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
      <p>
Whether it's about algorithms specific to solving problems such as searching,sorting,
arrays,graphs or trees problems,or encryption algorithms like:</p>
<dt>
<dl>RSA</dl>
<dl>AES</dl>
<dl>3DES</dl>
<dl>Blowfish</dl>
</dt>
And many others, algorithmics was one of my favorite subjects 
both in undergraduate and master's. Algorithms can be compared to the recipe of a 
cake, the steps of the algorithms for solving 
the problem being the steps in making the cake.
<br>And who doesn't love a good cake?

      <h2>Graphs, probabilities and statistics</h2>
      <p>
One of the many fields studied were the theories of graphs,
 combinatorics, statistics and probabilitys, even that of winning the lottery.
The certainty of these things was tested and verified with the 
help of programs made by us in Python.</p>
